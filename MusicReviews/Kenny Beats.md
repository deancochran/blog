## Review:
Kenny Beats is hands down, I repeat HANDS DOWN, my favorite producer. This guy has just perfect his craft. By the way if you don’t know him, he makes Grammy nominated music, and is kind of regarded as “the shit” right now. 

He collaborates with all the top artists, and just release his own debut album. This is why I wanted to make a review. His album “Louie” is a great addition to your library. Best to be enjoyed chronologically, and please get some good headphones. 

The album really picks up around “So They Say” in my opinion and holds the energy well throughout the rest of the album. Go friggin listen!
